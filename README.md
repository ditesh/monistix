# Monistix

Monistix collects machine instrumentation and logging data, and provides a beautiful web interface to view the data.

The agent is available under `agent` and the web frontend is available under `web`.

# Requirements

The agent requires Python 2.6 (or higher).

The web interface requires a running PHP 5.3.2 (or higher) setup backed by MySQL 5 (or higher).

Monistix has been tested on Linux platforms (specifically, Fedora 15).
