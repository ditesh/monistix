# Monistix

Monistix collects machine instrumentation and logging data, and provides a beautiful web interface to view the data.

Monistix agent is available under `agent`, and the web frontend is available under `web`.

# Requirements

The agent requires Python 2.6 (or higher). The web interface requires a running PHP setup backed by MySQL.

Monistix has been tested on Linux platforms (specifically, Fedora 15).

## Configuration
